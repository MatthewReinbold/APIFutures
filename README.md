## Are there any specific guidelines or requirements for contributing? 
Creators are expected to present the most pressing API challenge or exciting opportunity they see for the coming year (2024) and beyond. The exact contents, length, publish destination, or presentation style is entirely up to the individual creators. 

It would be helpful, though not required for participation, for creators promoting their published work across social media to use the hashtag, "#APIFutures". Most networks support tags, and discoverability is increased through the consistent application of a single label.

It is also desirable, though not required for participation, for each contribution to end with a call to action (below). This inclusion encourages the audience to check out other event contributions and create their own. Personalization of the call to action, including which other pieces are linked to, is entirely up to the creator's discretion. 

## Is there an option for participants to get feedback on their contribution before the final publishing date? 
If folks are interested in having a collaborative session to gather feedback on their contribution in either early December or January, contact Matthew Reinbold via email at *hello@matthewreinbold.com*.

## Where do I publish my APIFutures contribution?
Creators publish their contributions wherever they want! If you have a YouTube presence, post to your channel like usual on January 11th, 2024. If you have an email newsletter, hopefully, a special 'APIFutures' focused issue slots nicely into your editorial calendar! 

The point is that creators control how and where their work is presented. 

## Who owns the rights to content created for the APIFutures event? 
Creators maintain all rights to their contributions created for the APIFutures event. 

## How will others find my contribution?
All creators are encouraged to add a link to [a special APIFutures landing page listing the other participant's works](https://matthewreinbold.github.io/APIFutures/index.html). For YouTube, podcasts, or other non-textual media, creators are encouraged to leave the link to the APIFutures landing page in the description.
