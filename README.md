## Are there any specific guidelines or requirements for the contributions? 
Creators are expected to present the most pressing API challenge or exciting opportunity they see for the coming year (2024). The exact contents, length, publish destination, or presentation style is entirely up to the individual creators. 

It would be helpful, though not required for participation, for creators promoting their published work across social media to use the hashtag, "#APIFutures". Most networks support tags, and discoverability is increased through the consistent application of a single label.

It is also desirable, though not required for participation, for each contribution to end with a call to action (below). This inclusion encourages the audience to check out other event contributions and create their own. Personalization of the call to action, including which other pieces are linked to, is entirely up to the creator's discretion. 

## Is there an option for participants to get feedback on their contribution before the final publishing date? 
If folks are interested in having a collaborative session to gather feedback on their contribution in either early December or January, contact Matthew Reinbold via email at *hello@matthewreinbold.com*.

## Where do I publish my API Futures contribution?
Creators publish their contributions wherever they want! If you have a YouTube presence, post to your channel like usual. If you have an email newsletter, hopefully, a special 'API Futures' focused issue slots nicely into your editorial calendar! 

The point is that creators control how and where their work is presented. 

## Who owns the rights to content created for the API Futures event? 
Creators maintain all rights to their contributions created for the API Futures event. 

## How will others find my contribution?
All creators will be encouraged to add links to other participant's works after their piece. For YouTube, podcasts, or other non-textual media, creators are encouraged to leave links to other contributions in the description. 

Sample text will be provided that creators can copy and paste into their pieces **by January 9th**. 

## How do I submit a link to my contribution so others can link to it? 
When you have created your contribution, [submit the proposed URL via this Google Form](https://forms.gle/9UzNcMRQvxEYkshW6) prior to January 9th. If there aren't any questions upon review, the piece title, author, and link will be added to [the list of contributions for inclusion](https://github.com/MatthewReinbold/APIFutures/blob/main/2024-contributions.md). 

## Where do I find the list of other API Futures contributions for inclusion in my piece? 
A list of submitted contributions will be provided in markdown and copy/paste format at [the API Futures repository](https://github.com/MatthewReinbold/APIFutures/blob/main/2024-contributions.md). The example links and a final version will be provided by January 9th for inclusion in your draft pieces. 

## Can you summarize that process in a charmingly hand-drawn version that might be mistaken for the work of a child?
Certainly!

## Do I have to include links to other projects in my writing to participate? 
Which links you include in your contribution is entirely up to you! There may be situations where creators may be publishing to their work sites; in the process, there may be sensitivities about tacit recommendations of a competitor. In those cases, share the references to pieces you are comfortable with and avoid those that may be problematic.

## Is there any specific hashtag or phrase I should use when promoting our pieces on social media? 
When promoting your contribution on social media, please use the hashtag '**#APIFutures**'. 

## Is this a one-time event, or are there plans to make API Futures an annual event? 
There are no plans at the present time. If things go well and the community finds this useful, perhaps that will change. 

## Who do I contact if I have additional questions not covered here?
If there is a question about any of the above or something that hasn't been asked, please get in touch with Matthew Reinbold via email at *hello@matthewreinbold.com*.
